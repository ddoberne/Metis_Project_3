# Making It Big on Twitch
## Background
The rise of YouTube and Twitch has made some individual entertainers very, very wealthy and famous, and their success has subsequently opened up further career opportunities for them. For many, this is their dream; "making it" on social media like YouTube or Twitch to gain popularity and make a living.

The problem: the job title of "Social Media Personality" is one that is rapidly developing and without abundant historical precedent. For many, the best strategy they have at their disposal is trial and error, a very time-intensive and inconsistent process. Furthermore, there's a gigantic risk of failure along with little guarantee of payment, where somebody can spend endless hours for little monetary gain. The goal of this project is to provide insights in this rapidly developing field that can give someone an amount of certainty they wouldn't have otherwise and while saving them a lot of time.

This project is directed at [mcd00dle](https://www.twitch.tv/mcd00dle), a Twitch streamer with a modest following who is trying to decide if she wants to pursue playing music on Twitch as a career or become a music teacher. This project will be able to provide statistic-backed insights to help inform whether she could feasibly pursue a career in social media, and if so, what her best chance is for success. This is a large upgrade over the anecdotal evidence and survivor bias that is pervasive in the field.
## Design
## Data
Viewership data of the top 1600 music streamers from the past 3 months was taken from [sullygnome](https://sullygnome.com/). That data was cross-referenced with subscription data from [twitchstats](https://twitchstats.net/) to provide income and date of account creation.
## Tools/Techniques
* BeautifulSoup and Selenium were used for web scraping
* pandas was used to convert the scraped data into .csv form
* Google Sheets was used to merge the datasets, calculate new fields, clean the data, and filter the data for presentation
* Tableau was used for visualization
