*Note: data discussed for this project is discussed in the above link*

## Background

The purpose of this project is to determine if it is possible to earn a living by playing music on Twitch. If so, profiles of successful streamers will be explored and the goal is to determine what makes a streamer successful. For the purposes of this project, success is determined by a baseline monthly income of $1000/month from subscriptions (before tips). This information will be used to inform the future actions of aspiring Twitch streamers.

## Methods

A CSV containing information of the top 1600 streamers over the last three months in the Twitch Music directory was acquired from [sullygnome.com](https://sullygnome.com). Income data from those profiles was scraped from [twitchtracker.net](https://twitchtracker.net). Google Sheets was used to clean and filter the data, then Tableau was used for visualization.

## Results

I was successful in determining that streamers can be successful (greater than $1K monthly income) streaming music on Twitch. Roughly a third of the Partnered streamers observed were able to cross this threshold. Furthermore, those successful streamers are not limited to people who started their careers on Twitch a long time ago; streamers that created their account in 2019 or 2020 fall in the 'successful' category. Streams that were online for an average of over 5 hours a day were more likely to achieve this mark, though streamers in this category are playlists that run continuously.

## Future Steps

The next steps of the project are to piece together each streamer's social media activity and profile by scraping their Twitch About page. From there, more specific insights can be made on how a streamer can become successful.
